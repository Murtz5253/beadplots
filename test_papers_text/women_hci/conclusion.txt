CONCLUSION We presented the gender-related complexities that Indian women face in computing and HCI throughout their life time, drawing from qualitative research with Indian researchers, practitioners, and students. Against a backdrop of entrenched gender discrimination and relatively low literacy rates, India provides a interesting case study of women in computing. Cultural and economic expectations around working in the software industry forged supportive environments for women in the undergraduate and Master’s levels (45% women in undergraduate CS programs); but swiftly devolved into discrimination and eventual exit from Ph.D., academia, and IT jobs (where women constitute 80% of entry-level jobs). Specifically, societal stigma against highly qualified women, limited female role models for the family, unfriendly work policies, and delayed promotions affect professional progress. HCI suffers from the converse effect—in viewing HCI education as arts-centric, the field was viewed as less desirable to enter the IT force (only an estimated 25-30% women in HCI programs). Over and above the perception, women were discriminated in the core aspects of HCI research, such as fieldwork, brainstorming, and design critiques. 

Future work could extend inquiry to lower-tier colleges, other gender-inequal countries, and include parents and partners of women. We hope that by bringing attention to the societal influence on women’s education and careers, we can move towards more equitable computing and HCI for all.
