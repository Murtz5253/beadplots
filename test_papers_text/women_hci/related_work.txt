RELATED WORK Our research relates to three main strands of related work. First, the significant literature examining the many factors leading to low representation of women in computing in genderequal countries, particularly the United States where prior work covers a lot of ground. Second, a less exhaustive literature considering similar questions in India, the context of this research. Finally, feminist scholarship in HCI and computing, mainly in gender-equal countries.

Gender disparity in computing in the United States Women in computing in the United States face stiff headwinds throughout their lifetimes. The problems begin with sociocultural factors such as gender stereotypes [32], subtle biases against girls in early education [47], and lack of encouragement and exposure [33]. These forces continue throughout formal schooling through university education leading to drop in confidence levels [12, 23]. At work, related socio-cultural factors and sexism lead women to disproportionately consider leaving the workplace [13, 26]. Issues such as gendered work environments, childcare duties, and a lack of female role models are cited as prominent factors leading to the attrition of women in science professions [62], in research [46], and in academia [69, 22]. Current work identifies barriers at specific phases, which we extend further by comparing against various career stages in computing and HCI in India.

Gender disparity in computing in India India has one of the lowest participation rates of women in the labor market at 27 % [3, 37, 16]. In India’s IT industry, women were a negligible presence in the 1980s, but their numbers have steadily grown since, comprising approximately 30% of IT workers today [65]. In other words, women in Indian IT have matched the rate of participation of women in the general workforce. The change has been attributed to market forces and changing social norms related to the booming IT economy within the constraints of a patrifocal society [27]. However, women’s participation is disproportionately limited to junior positions (80% by one measure [53]), and the same “glass ceilings” afflicting U.S. tech companies appears to exist in India as well [28]. Venkatesh et al. [66] find that in STEM research careers, promotions depended more on gender than on productivity. Gupta [29] notes that social prejudice against working women greatly limits women from obtaining top positions. Although the above work addresses Indian women’s technology careers in piecemeal fashion, no systemic analysis of their career trajectories has been conducted. Our study performs such an analysis across women’s various adult career life stages. To the best of our knowledge, prior research about women in HCI in India does not exist. 

Feminist HCI scholarship Gender studies has a long history of investigating women and work (e.g., [15]), and the gender lens has been extended to the field of HCI [38, 5]. Issues central to feminism such as agency, identity, subjectivity, and cultural difference have been brought to light in HCI, by Bardzell and Churchill [5, 4]. Satchell [57] and Inkpen [35] have argued for considering gender in design practices in HCI. Kotamraju [38] and Light [40] have discussed the gendered identities of female researchers and the performative acts they play in conducting HCI research. To further the community of female HCI researchers and feminism in HCI, several workshops have been held [19, 18]. While gender-sensitive design practices and values have been a major area of inquiry in HCI, less attention has been paid to the representation and experiences of female HCI researchers globally. One exception is work by Dray et al [19], which found that women in the Global North are attracted to HCI owing to its creative bent. In this work, we seek to broaden feminist HCI scholarship to the Indian context with an intersectional lens [58]. We apply a pluralist [5] approach and contribute to the body of knowledge about factors affecting CS careers in the Global South.
