REFLECTION We now reflect on the value of this framework for shaping future HCI research agendas. We have shown that the challenges to trust are pervasive affecting all Bitcoin stakeholders, albeit in different ways. They are also interdependent, as distinct user groups may have conflicted goals. Not at least, some trust challenges are hidden, i.e., minersâ€™ activity is seldom open for scrutiny. We argue that a user-centered approach to the exploration of trust can shed light into the challenges experienced by people using Bitcoin. This is radically different than the current algorithmic approach to trust in Bitcoin. Research supported by our framework can also open up novel design opportunities to address the identified challenges and support trust. For example, one can imagine new class of interactive technologies where trust is captured, materialized and gained or lost through exchanges. This new design space for decentralized interactive cryptocurrency technologies may not only support better adoption of Bitcoin technology but also the digital currency economy at large.
