CONCLUSION This paper introduces a HCI research framework arguing for the importance of exploring trust in Bitcoin technology. The framework builds on theoretical perspectives on trust and discriminates between technological, social and institutional trust, mapped against the four identified Bitcoin stakeholders: users, miners, exchanges and merchants. We have used the framework as a lens for identifying the issues of Bitcoin trust, and shown that they are pervasive, hidden and interdependent. The value of this the framework for HCI research agendas has been also discussed.
