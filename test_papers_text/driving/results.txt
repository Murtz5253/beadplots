4 RESULTS 4.1 Autonomous Vehicle Acceptance Model Questionnaire To verify the hypotheses H1.1, H1.2 and H1.3 we used the AVAM [25]. The results of the groups were not normally distributed. Therefore, a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was performed for the dependent samples and a Mann-Whitney test for the independent samples instead of an ANOVA. We calculated the Cronbach Alpha [6] for all variables to see if they have an adequate internal consistency. Results with p<0.05 are reported as significant. Since the questionnaire has 26 items and was used four times during the tests the focus lies on the questions relevant for the hypotheses.

4.1.1 Hypothesis1.1 – Increased Perceived Feeling of Safety. We grouped question item 24, 25 and 26 under the variable perceived safety by the AVAM. This variable does not show any significant changes between the groups,see Table 2. Hence, there is no evidence that supports hypothesis H1.1.

4.1.2 Hypothesis1.2 – Increased Understanding and Ease of Use. Question items 4, 5, and 6 are grouped under the variable efort expectancy by the AVAM. The results are shown in Table 3.

We expected a positive effect of additional explanatory information on the perceived ease of use and the understanding of the system. It was found that the mobile application could significantly increase the perceived ease of use and the understanding of the system. This, however, was only true for group A where no live explanations were provided (Adrive=5.15, Aapp=5.93, p=0.0025). In the case of group B, who had live explanations, the mobile application used after the drive had no significant effect. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between the groups during the drive (Adrive=5.15, Bdrive=5.82, p=0.0495). Overall, group B, where live explanations were provided, had higher ratings in ease of use and understanding of the system than group A. Regarding the mobile application, the group comparison was not significant.

4.1.3 Hypothesis1.3 – Increased Interest. The AVAM groups the question items 13, 14, and 15 under the variable attitude towards using technology. The results are shown in Table 4. None of the questions relevant to hypothesis H1.3 showed significant changes. Hence, there is no evidence that supports hypothesis H1.3 from the experiment.

4.2 User Experience Questionnaire We analysed the UEQ-S to verify the hypothesis H2 – Increased User Experience. Figure 5 shows the results for the four different user test runs. The questionnaire reliability was measured using Cronbach alpha [6]. The UEQ-S defines values > 0.8 as a positive evaluation and values < -0.8 as a negative evaluation. Looking at the UEQ-S results, there is a strong indication that the hypothesis H2 is valid.

Participants rated the drive without live explanations (Adrive) with a neutral PQ (M=-0.59, α=0.67), a negative HQ (M=-1.41, α=0.88) leading to a negative overall score (M=-1.00). They rated the mobile application after the drive without live explanations (Aapp) with a neutral PQ (M=0.06, α=0.55) and a neutral HQ (M=- 0.26, α=0.86) leading to a neutral overall score (M=-0.08). For the drive with live explanations (Bdrive) participants evaluated the PQ (M=0.18, α=0.89) and the HQ as neutral (M=-0.51, α=0.71) which resulted in a neutral overall score (M=-0.17). The mobile application after the drive with explanations (Bapp) was rated with a neutral PQ (M=0.30, α=0.90), a neutral HQ (M=-0.50, (α=0.89) and a neutral overall score (M=-0.10) by the participants. A Wilcoxon Signed Rank test revealed significant changes between Adrive and Aapp (p<0.001). A Mann-Whitney test showed significant changes between Adrive and Bdrive (p<0.001).

The UEQ-S results show that providing information on a mobile app after the drive without live explanations significantly increased the passengers’ UX from negative to neutral. Using the application after the drive with additional explanatory information produced almost the same results and did not show an increased UX. Providing passengers with additional explanatory information during the drive, compared to no additional explanatory information, significantly increases their UX from negative to neutral. The results show that live explanations or explanations after the ride can increase the passengers’ UX. However, as the results are still far from being above 0.8, the hypothesis is partly accepted

4.3 Perceived Feeling of Control All groups showed significant diferences regarding the feeling of control, see Table 5. Providing an application after the ride significantly increases the feeling of control for both groups (Adrive=2.70, Aapp=3.40, p=0.0205) (Bdrive=3.70, Bapp=4.20, p=0.0255), meaning that even passengers who received live explanations benefit from the mobile app. Providing passengers with live explanations during the ride also increases the feeling of control compared to the group that did not receive any information during the drive (Adrive=2.70, Bdrive=3.70, p=0.0175). Hence, there is a strong indication that hypothesis H3 – Increased Feeling of Control is valid

Subsequently, we further analysed the relationship between the UX and the feeling of control (see Table 6). All word pairs, except complicated – easy, showed a weak to medium significant correlation to the feeling of control. As expected, we saw a positive correlation between a clear UX and feeling of control. However, the HQ dimensions are correlating stronger than the PQ. Therefore, a subjective feeling of control is a relevant factor when aiming for a positive UX.

4.4 Post Interview As described in Table 4, we conducted interviews after the ride and after the app usage in addition to the questionnaires. We asked participants to describe how they felt during the ride, if there were situations in which something was unclear or in which they felt unwell. Participants were also asked how they would evaluate their system interaction particularly with regard to the shuttle’s communication. They were also asked if they had anything else to add. Participants were able to freely articulate their thoughts during these interviews.

A summary of the transcribed and shortened statements from participants of both group A and B are shown in Table 7. The original statements were given in German. We clustered similar meanings together and referenced them by a shortened statement. The clustering was based on an inter-rater agreement of three raters on those terms. The overall numbers show how many of the participants have expressed the statement. It does certainly not indicate that other participants would have agreed or disagreed with the statement. The statements should only be seen as complementary to the questionnaire results above.

The shuttle’s driving is evaluated as slow from both groups. However, there is a distinction in the utterances if either the shuttle’s driving itself is seen as slow or the time it took the shuttle to make a decision is seen as slow. The latter is mostly expressed by participants from group B, as they had access to the visualisations and the additional information from the shuttle during the ride. This indicates that they were more aware of the shuttle’s actual manoeuvre planning, and it seems that the attention shifted from the shuttle’s slow driving to the shuttle’s slow decision making.

For 13 participants of group A, who did not get live explanations, the shuttle’s driving reactions were not clear. 7 participants of group B shared this opinion. In contrast, the shuttle’s driving reactions were clear to 12 participants of group B, and 11 participants of group B also stated that the live explanations on the screen were comprehensible. These statements support the increased HQ between Adrive and Bdrive in the UEQ-S results as well as the significant changes in the AVAM effort expectancy shown in Table 3.

Only few participants commented that the ride was interesting (4 from group A, 2 from group B), 9 participants from group A and 3 from group B commented the ride to be boring. Similarly, we did not find a clear distinction for hypothesis H1.3 with regard to AVAM’s attitude towards using technology shown in Table 4.

In terms of perceived feeling of control, 5 people of group A stated that they did not feel in control compared to 3 of group B. These statements slightly support the significant result of Table 5 of hypothesis H3. A large number of participants stated to feel well during the ride, namely 10 of group A and 14 of group B.

When asked about the app usage, a larger number of participants from group A found the app to be helpful, whereas a larger number of participants of group B found the app to be unnecessary or unhelpful. This seems comprehensible as participants of group B already got the live explanations during the ride and had no interest in seeing them again after the ride. This adds to the differences between before and after app usage of group A and B, as described in section 4.2.
