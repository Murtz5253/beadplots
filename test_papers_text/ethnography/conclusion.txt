CONCLUDING REMARKS In this paper we have discussed how design ethnography and design fiction are tools to aid and abet design processes. By reviewing these practices, we have established that they have common goals and furthermore there are some similarities in the ways that they work toward these goals. We hypothesize that these similar properties can be linked in a way that is mutually beneficial to both endeavors. Once these properties are connected, anticipatory ethnography emerges as a nascent practice.

Anticipatory ethnography addresses design fiction’s need for methods, capitalizing on design ethnography’s richer methodological history. Building on an ability to adapt and reconfigure itself there are benefits for design ethnography too. By subverting traditional notions of situated observation design ethnography achieves a new temporal liberty

In light of the pace of change in the 21st century, along with the increasingly vivid notions of ‘future shock’ and ‘wicked problems’11, we feel that new ways of understanding and preempting the future are more starkly compelling than ever before. The vastness of the problem space that we’re concerned with requires a suitably bold response, by presenting our position on anticipatory ethnography we have taken steps towards such a response.

In order to see the vision become a reality further research is needed. We call upon the design fiction and design ethnography communities to come together in order to develop these ideas, extend the concept, and demonstrate the merits, shortcomings, relevance and scope of this work, through empirical investigations.
