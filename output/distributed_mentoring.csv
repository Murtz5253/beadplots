young people worldwide are participating in ever-increasing 
numbers in online fan communities. far from mere shallow 
repositories of pop culture, these sites are accumulating 
significant evidence that sophisticated informal learning is 
taking place online in novel and unexpected ways. in order 
to understand and analyze in more detail how learning might 
be occurring, we conducted an in-depth nine-month 
ethnographic investigation of online fanfiction communities, 
including participant observation and fanfiction author 
interviews. our observations led to the development of a 
theory we term distributed mentoring, which we present in 
detail in this paper. distributed mentoring exemplifies one 
instance of how networked technology affords new 
extensions of behaviors that were previously bounded by 
time and space. distributed mentoring holds potential for 
application beyond the spontaneous mentoring observed in 
this investigation and may help students receive diverse, 
thoughtful feedback in formal learning environments as well.
","introduction
in a 45-minute period during the afternoon on monday, may 
4, 2015, 100 new fanfiction stories were published on the 
online repository fanfiction.net. fanfiction is immensely 
popular among adolescents and young adults, and this popularity is evident in the millions of stories housed in 
online fanfiction repositories. fanfiction.net is the 440th 
most popular website in the united states, and its visitors are 
overwhelmingly teens and emerging adults [1]. fanfiction
authors have written stories housed on fanfiction.net that are 
several hundred thousand words in length, even longer than 
the original works on which the stories were based. this abundance of literary production stands in sharp 
contrast to popular wisdom that today’s young people are not 
interested in or even capable of long-form writing and use 
technology primarily for shallow interactions on social 
media [11,23,59,62]. what is it about fanfiction experiences 
that foster such engaged participation among youth? we set 
out to investigate why members of a generation often 
maligned for placing video games ahead of books are so 
engaged in this form of writing. during this analysis, we 
communicated directly with young fanfiction authors in 
addition to observing interactions between authors and 
readers over the course of nine months. in the process, we 
discovered evidence of a type of community-based learning 
and mentoring that is uniquely facilitated by the 
technological affordances of the web. moving beyond 
formal mentoring, people have developed a network-enabled 
form of giving and receiving feedback, actively correlating 
knowledge gleaned in small pieces from a large community 
to inform their fanfiction writing. as this knowledge is 
embodied in artifacts of interaction between community 
members, we draw on and extend hutchins’ framework of 
distributed cognition [30,31] and dawson’s mentoring 
framework [18]
in naming this process distributed 
mentoring.
","previous work and background
fanfiction
scholars have explored fanfiction from a number of angles, 
including legality [47,55,57], literacy [8,35], instructional 
potential [12,44], sexuality [34,58], and identity [3,8]. jenkins’
[34] seminal investigation of fanfiction occurred more than 20 
years ago as part of a larger study of fan culture. challenging 
negative stereotypes of fans, jenkins depicted them “as active 
producers and manipulators of meanings” [34]. he identified 
fanfiction as a prime example of how fans engage actively with 
original creative works by referencing, manipulating, and 
extending them in new and unexpected ways. fanfiction has existed since the 1960s, developing within the 
fandoms for television shows like star trek [34]. however,
the distribution of fanfiction has substantially changed with 
the advent of internet-based fanfiction repositories. removing 
the physical constraints of printing has lowered the barriers
to reader critique, with the result that there may be hundreds 
or thousands of reviews submitted for a single fanfiction
story. additionally, the public, persistent, and immediate 
nature of online reviews allows for instant and highly 
interactive communication among reviewers as well as the 
fanfiction authors themselves. this dramatic decrease in the 
cost of providing feedback to authors has led to far greater 
volumes of information being exchanged among larger 
numbers of participants in online fanfiction communities, 
enabling a complex web of support, commentary, 
communication, and mentoring that could not have been 
possible with older technologies: what we term distributed 
mentoring.
","methods
drawing on a rich set of data sources, we describe the 
learning and mentoring that take place in fanfiction
communities from the perspective of the authors, and present 
the results of our analyses of fanfiction user groups and story 
reviews. we define learning as a process of deepening 
participation in a social practice, and mentoring as positive 
support for this process [33,36,42]. we detail the theory of 
distributed mentoring that grew out of our ethnographic 
investigation of fanfiction communities and suggest its 
potential impact for computer-mediated learning.
","findings
the fanfiction authors we interviewed
believed that 
participating in fanfiction communities was both a source of 
emotional support and an avenue to improve the quality of 
their writing. they attributed these benefits to the varied 
forms of informal mentoring they received in the 
communities to which they belonged. our participant 
observations led us to identify seven distinct attributes 
associated with the mentoring processes that participants 
described.
","discussion

we set out to understand what adolescents and young adults 
were learning from their participation in online fanfiction
communities, how this learning took place, and what part 
mentoring played. we initially anticipated that we would 
uncover traditional mentoring relationships where less 
experienced writers learned from more experienced writers; 
instead, during our investigation, we encountered a rich and 
interwoven tapestry of interactive, cumulatively sophisticated 
advice and informal instruction that added up to a networked 
experience we have termed distributed mentoring.
","limitations and future directions
as is inherent in most qualitative research, our site for this 
study was limited. we investigated only three fandoms and 
two fanfiction repositories in detail; therefore, our findings 
may not generalize to mentoring in online affinity groups at 
large. there may be unique aspects specific to these two 
fanfiction communities that encourage members to leave 
more feedback. the communities we observed were very 
civil, as shown by the low amount of trolling present in story 
reviews. this civility was surprising because readers can 
leave anonymous reviews on fanfiction.net, and anonymous 
forms of online communication have a reputation for being 
susceptible to trolling [46]. this civility could in part be a 
legacy of the benign atmosphere found in early fanfiction
zines’ letters of comment; it may be that other affinity 
spaces that lack this legacy may not be supportive enough to 
sustain distributed mentoring [34].
","conclusion
online fanfiction communities represent affinity spaces in 
which authors, brought together by a passion for the fandom, 
provide support for each other in their creative endeavors. 
through in-depth interviews and participant observations, 
we identified and documented a unique style of mentoring 
occurring in these communities that we named distributed 
mentoring, inspired by hutchins’ [30] theory of distributed 
cognition. in our investigation, we observed and described 
seven key attributes of distributed mentoring that distinguish 
it from traditional, offline forms of mentoring and tie it to the 
particular affordances of networked publics: aggregation, 
accretion, 
acceleration, 
abundance, 
availability, 
asynchronicity, and affect. distributed mentoring involves 
numerous 
participants 
answering 
questions, 
leaving 
feedback, and engaging each other in asynchronous 
conversations that in the aggregate yield a positive mentoring 
experience. the authors we interviewed valued the feedback 
they received from the community and viewed it as an 
important part of their growth as writers. aside from its role 
in online communities, distributed mentoring may also 
present opportunities, as described in the implications 
section, for collaborative learning in other learning contexts, 
including formal educational contexts.
","acknowledgments
we thank the reviewers who provided thoughtful and 
detailed comments on previous iterations of this document. 
the final paper has been greatly improved by their feedback. 
we also extend gratitude to our participants in this study and 
our colleague, jeff giorgi.

","while “distributed mentoring” has been used previously by 
other scholars [16,40,50] to describe mentors who are 
geographically distributed or collectively based, our use of 
the term is novel because of its grounding in hutchins’ 
concept of distributed cognition, and because it is not just the 
people but also the mentoring itself that is distributed. we
identify seven key attributes of distributed mentoring that 
distinguish it from traditional, offline forms of mentoring 
and tie it both to hutchins’ theory of distributed cognition and to the particular affordances of networked publics. these 
attributes 
are: 
aggregation, 
accretion, 
acceleration, 
abundance, availability, asynchronicity, and affect.
","following jenkins’ investigation of fanfiction, black [6–8]
investigated language acquisition and identity formation 
among english language learners participating in online 
fanfiction
communities. black analyzed the dialogue 
between authors and readers in the form of story reviews and 
authors’ notes. she found that these interactions helped the 
authors shape their learning space and identity. black’s 
focus, however, was primarily on how reviews affected individual authors’ identity formation over time. we still 
lack insight into the complex structure of the network of 
fanfiction reviews and the impact that an entire community 
of reviewers may have on authors’ creative processes and 
skill development. this topic is worth further exploration in 
light of fanfiction’s popularity and the encouragement that 
authors profess to feel because of reader reviews. 
understanding this phenomenon in more depth may provide 
insights into how young people could be encouraged to 
develop their skills as writers as well as their enjoyment of 
the writing process in arenas outside the fanfiction world. in 
this way, our work contributes to existing work exploring the 
use of fanfiction and other forms of fan creation to support 
learning in formal and informal educational settings [43,49].
","the following research questions guided this study:
1. how and what do young people learn through their 
involvement in fanfiction communities?
2. what role does mentoring play in participants’ 
learning, and what does this mentoring look like? our investigation centered on interviews with a sample of 28 
young fanfiction authors and a nine-month period of 
participant observations in fanfiction communities.
","learning to write, learning about life
our findings provide evidence of the learning and mentoring 
occurring in fanfiction communities. it was striking, given 
how many online communities are not supportive [23], that 
every author we interviewed emphasized that support from 
the community contributed to their development as writers.
","grounded in hutchins’ [30] theory of distributed cognition, 
distributed mentoring takes as its base the fact that 
knowledge is distributed across people and artifacts and the 
aggregation of this knowledge is greater and qualitatively 
different from the knowledge residing in any one individual 
or artifact. as a result, distributed mentoring is most likely to 
be found in online affinity spaces [24,25]. consistent with 
gee’s description of an affinity space but with a particular 
focus on mentoring processes, we found that mentoring 
resources were shared socially to extend and broaden the 
influence and knowledge from the domain of the individual to 
the group, so that a greater effect was achieved than through traditional mentoring. this was made possible and facilitated 
specifically by networked publics and thus did not occur in fan 
communities before the advent of widespread online 
communication. as in distributed cognition, mentoring 
processes are distributed among humans and artifacts in the 
environment, and mentoring systems are formed where 
complex structure emerges in ways that enhance the reach of 
any single individual. however, distributed mentoring extends 
hutchins’ concept of distributed cognition by focusing 
specifically on mentoring processes as well as the influence of 
networked technologies’ distinct affordances.
","we are not able to claim for certain that distributed 
mentoring directly affects writing ability. we set out to 
understand and describe the type of mentoring present in 
online fanfiction communities, leaving the verification of its 
effect to later research. many of the authors we interviewed 
believed that the feedback they received from the fanfiction
community helped improve their writing, but our research 
was observational in nature, not experimental. there are a 
number of other potential learning resources in these young 
authors’ lives that have certainly impacted their writing, 
although we think on the basis of our findings that distributed 
mentoring is one of them.

"
2,,"grounded in a sociocultural tradition of theory and research, 
our work builds upon and extends previous research
addressing the role of mentoring in affinity spaces and
communities of practice [16,24,25,40,42,50] by delving into 
the specific processes by which knowledge is shared, the 
distinct affordances of networked platforms that facilitate 
this sharing, and how writers experience these processes of 
knowledge sharing. in this way, we extend prior work by 
articulating a new theoretical understanding of networked 
mentoring processes and how they differ from a traditional 
model of mentoring. we believe that the theoretical construct 
of distributed mentoring may be of benefit in understanding 
learning processes in other formal and informal learning 
environments.
","affinity spaces, participatory culture, and connected 
learning
the present study takes as its starting point the recognition 
that fanfiction communities function as affinity spaces
[8,36]. gee [24] described an affinity space as an “interest-
driven passion-fuelled site,” where personal differences in 
age, gender, or class are less important than the shared 
interest being explored. like communities of practice [42], 
affinity spaces are distinct contexts of learning and identity 
formation where novices become experts through guided 
participation in the social structure of the community
[24,25]. however, black [8] distinguishes between the two 
by observing that in affinity spaces there are a range of 
different novice and expert roles that vary based on context, 
whereas in communities of practice, apprentices are being 
trained toward one type of full participation using a well-
defined body of knowledge. in a fanfiction community, 
authors may be apprentices and masters at the same time, 
possessing expertise in one aspect of the craft, such as 
characterization, grammar, or canon knowledge, but 
requiring assistance in other aspects. in the present work, we 
expand on gee’s concept of affinity spaces and related work 
around networked practices of feedback [8,38,41,54] by 
exploring how the distinct affordances of networked 
technologies shape and transform mentoring processes in 
affinity spaces. in so doing, we demonstrate how the concept of 
distributed mentoring offers new insights into collaborative 
mentoring processes in networked environments.
","we selected our three fandoms based upon the diversity of 
each fandom’s genre (e.g. science fiction, fantasy, and 
animation), medium (e.g. tv, book) and length of time in 
existence. our selection was also guided by the research 
team’s personal familiarity with the fandoms, as significant 
fandom knowledge was necessary for understanding the 
discussions and stories in these communities. we selected 
three fandoms instead of focusing on one to make sure that 
what we witnessed was not an aberration within a single 
fandom. additionally, we chose widely popular fandoms to 
ensure the size of the community and amount of material was 
sufficient for our study. we purposely opted for fandoms 
based on original story material (versus music group or 
hobby-based fandoms) because they inspire the majority of 
fanfiction writing as readers seek to extend the story and 
utilize the original text as mentor text [20,35]. study sites
fanfiction.net is the largest fanfiction repository on the 
internet with over six million registered users; it hosts more than five million fanfictions across thousands of fandoms. as 
of july 2015, the largest fandom on fanfiction.net was harry 
potter, with 719,000 fanfictions, followed by naruto, with 
386,000. in addition to hosting fanfiction, fanfiction.net has 
social features, such as communities, forums, beta-reader 
listings, and a private messaging system. users on 
fanfiction.net have profile pages that list the stories they have 
authored, the stories and authors they have marked as 
favorites, and introductory profile messages.
","writing fanfiction and getting instant feedback over 
the past couple of years has improved my writing 
significantly. i still have a long way to go, but i mostly 
avoid the standard pitfalls that young writers fall into 
such as poor flow and sentence construction, flat 
dialogue, and trivial descriptions.
- author 19 (my little pony)for most of the authors we interviewed, fanfiction was their 
first foray into creative writing, and it was fanfiction that 
taught them that they liked writing and gave them the desire 
to pursue original fiction. author 11 has already produced an 
original fiction and attributed its existence to the confidence 
gained from writing fanfiction:my original novel is due for publication next month. 
it's a fantasy fiction, part one of a planned four series. 
if it wasn't for the confidence i got from writing my 
fanfictions, i would never have even dreamed of self-
publishing my own work.
- author 11 (harry potter)authors also learned life lessons beyond writing from 
participating in fanfiction communities. author 26 (my 
little pony) felt that the creative thinking involved in writing 
fanfiction helped him become more open-minded about 
other things, stating, “if anything, thinking of premises for 
stories that can fit inside of canon has taught me to think 
outside of the box and expand things.” author 27 (my little 
pony) noted that in addition to learning about grammar, he 
has also learned to be more tolerant and willing to help others 
because of his community participation.
","distributed mentoring also pushes at the framework for 
traditional mentoring models established by dawson [18]. 
most of these design elements become irrelevant or extremely 
varied within the informal structure of the online fanfiction
community. 
selection 
and 
matching 
of 
mentoring
relationships, crucial components of most traditional models, 
are entirely self-driven in fanfiction communities. roles, 
cardinality (number of relationships), ties, relative seniority, 
and time vary both by individuals and by task (e.g.
proofreading versus plotting). there is no mentorship training, 
the rewards are all intrinsic, and the monitoring is 
crowdsourced. yet, powerful and effective mentorship occurs 
daily within these sites for thousands of authors. therefore, a 
new mentoring model is happening that is uniquely supported 
by the affordances of networked technologies and for which 
we must account. the seven attributes we identified—
aggregation, accretion, acceleration, abundance, availability, 
asynchronicity, and affect—illustrate how the affordances of 
networked technologies give rise to distributed mentoring and 
set it apart from traditional mentoring.
","as distributed mentoring is a nascent concept, there are many 
opportunities to explore regarding its effectiveness and 
application, as well as its limitations. more work is needed to determine how distributed mentoring impacts writing quality, 
especially in comparison with other types of mentoring or 
formal education. does the computer-mediated nature of 
distributed mentoring allow for a more diverse and therefore 
richer mentoring experience compared to in-person peer 
mentoring? does writing ability improve more when writers

3,,,"the present work is also informed by participatory culture 
and connected learning principles, which networked affinity 
spaces are well positioned to support. according to jenkins
[36], a participatory culture is “a culture with relatively low 
barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong 
support for creating and sharing creations, and some type of 
informal mentorship whereby experienced participants pass 
along knowledge to novices” [36]. fanfiction communities 
promote participatory culture by virtue of their low barrier to 
entry—anyone of any age can write and publish a story—and 
their high level of peer support and mentoring. the concept 
of distributed mentoring extends jenkins’ work around 
participatory culture by delving more deeply into the 
relationship between the affordances of networked technologies and the mentoring processes we observed in 
fanfiction communities. in so doing, we draw on ito et al.’s 
model of connected learning [33], which is defined by three 
core properties: learners come together around a shared 
purpose, a focus on production, and openly networked 
infrastructures. our work illustrates
how these three 
properties support and give rise to new forms of openly 
networked, collaborative mentoring.
","fimfiction.net is a single-fandom fanfiction repository 
dedicated to the television show my little pony: friendship 
is magic. as of july 2015, fimfiction.net had 185,014 users 
and 86,009 published stories [22]. once users create an
account on fimfiction.net, they can access user groups, 
which include a common fanfiction repository and a 
discussion forum. any member can create a group and there 
are more than 7,000 groups in existence. group topics range 
from support groups for writers with learning disorders to 
groups 
dedicated 
to 
favorite 
minor 
characters. 
fimfiction.net user pages are more customizable than 
profile pages on fanfiction.net, and users have the option to 
write blog entries, leave public comments on other users’ pages,
and create custom content modules and image galleries. like 
fanfiction.net, fimfiction.net also has a private messaging 
system where users can communicate directly.
","some authors found emotional support or release from 
fanfiction. author 16 felt that the response she received from 
the fanfiction community helped her get through a difficult 
period in her life:
i've received literally thousands of positive reviews 
and some truly wonderful letters and messages from 
people who have been genuinely touched by my 
writing, and it's been a massive confidence boost that helped me get through university without quitting and 
still helps me today if i'm feeling down.
- author 16 (harry potter)diverse forms of mentoring
in seeking to determine how the learning in fanfiction
communities takes place, we uncovered diverse forms of 
mentoring. authors we interviewed revealed that they 
experienced mentoring in contexts beyond a traditional 
dyadic mentor/mentee relationship. fanfiction communities 
connect thousands of authors together and provide the 
opportunity for immediate and diverse feedback. authors 
described a rich network of resources that they could draw 
on which included fanfiction reviews, fimfiction.net user 
groups, beta readers, co-writers, skype groups, podcasts, 
internet relay chat (irc), and other message boards and 
communities. authors received and provided assistance 
through these channels in one-to-one, one-to-many, and 
many-to-one mentoring instances. individually, these 
interactions with readers via story reviews or other authors 
via message boards may be too small to be considered 
mentoring, but in the aggregate they form a richer, more 
complete form of mentoring that is distributed across many 
participants and communication channels.
","previous work has detailed the distinct affordances of 
networked technologies [10,61] as well as how they support 
new social forms, such as participatory culture [35,36] and 
connected learning
[33]. the attributes of distributed 
mentoring we have identified are consistent with the 
characteristics of participatory culture (e.g. low barriers to 
entry, informal mentorship) and supported by the core 
properties of connected learning (shared purpose, production-
centered, openly networked). however, the theory of 
distributed mentoring extends prior work by focusing 
explicitly on the interplay between mentoring and networked 
technologies, showing how the affordances of networked 
technologies shape mentoring processes in new ways. for instance, the persistent quality of computer-mediated 
communication (cmc) makes it possible for authors to 
consider multiple voices together, both in the moment and at 
a later date, supporting the attributes of aggregation, 
accretion, acceleration, and asynchronicity [19,53]. this 
may be challenging in non-cmc contexts, where human 
memory limits the number of previous responses a 
participant can consider. in addition, the public nature of 
communicating in networked environments like fanfiction
sites allows for a high level of interaction among reviewers, 
who can react to and build on each other’s comments asynchronously and over the long term. this quality of 
networked communication supports the attributes of 
abundance, availability, and affect. in contrast, traditional 
ideas of mentoring are grounded primarily in one-to-one 
relationships, which are easier to maintain in the physical 
world. mentoring facilitated by the internet can move past 
the limitations of the physical world to allow numerous 
mentors to engage each other on the same topic 
asynchronously when providing advice to mentees.
","additionally, we did not investigate how website structure and 
design aids or impedes distributed mentoring, although we did 
observe different styles of distributed mentoring on different 
websites. writers on fimfiction.net frequently received help on 
user group forums, while writers on fanfiction.net often 
received help from reviews in reply to authors’ notes. we 
wonder if a particular style of feedback mechanism (e.g., 
forums) yields superior mentoring experiences. also, do more 
opportunities for users to leave feedback actually yield more 
feedback, and what is the quality of this feedback?
",,,
4,,,"mentoring
mentoring relationships represent a common thread in 
descriptions of affinity spaces, communities of practice, 
participatory culture, and connected learning. mentors 
provide community participants with support in developing 
the skills and competencies necessary for full and productive 
participation in the community. in fanfiction communities 
specifically, informal peer mentors help authors improve 
their writing skills by providing feedback and answering 
questions [8].
","we also interacted with and observed the doctor who 
fanfiction repository a teaspoon and an open mind
(whofic.com), the my little pony: friendship is magic 
discussion board ponychan.net, livejournal.com fanfiction
communities, and reddit.com fanfiction subreddits.
","differences in the affordances of fanfiction platforms give 
rise 
to 
distinct 
mentoring 
forms. 
for 
instance, 
fimfiction.net includes a number of user groups, which 
several of the authors we interviewed said they relied on as a 
writing resource. each user group has an associated forum, 
and in the writing help groups we observed, the members 
used these forums as a place to elicit advice on problematic 
aspects of their fanfiction stories (e.g. characterization and 
writing style) and to discuss general writing tips. the forums 
are publicly accessible, so any group member can respond to 
any post. in some cases, respondents would provide advice 
to the original poster independently without referencing what 
other respondents stated, but in other cases respondents 
would debate, correct, or agree with the advice provided by 
other respondents, often adding to it. for example, one poster 
described a rubric for creating an antagonist, and 21 group 
members posted completed rubrics while four members 
contributed additional information on the topic and 
commented on others’ rubrics. one respondent added a ‘map 
of evil’ with different categories and characteristics of evil 
traits and left a caveat stating that “not all antagonists have 
to be evil. in fact, making your reader sympathize with an 
antagonist is an advanced narrative technique.” another 
respondent who had previously posted a completed rubric 
replied “funny you should mention this. i plan to try this out 
with my next antagonist.” these lively forum posts provide 
the original posters with a rich set of differing perspectives, 
something they would not have had access to if they had asked 
questions through more private, one-to-one channels to 
individual mentors (we term this aggregation, detailed below).
","benefits of distributed mentoring
the fanfiction authors emphasized how much they valued 
the mentoring that they received from the larger community, 
which they viewed as an important part of their growth as 
writers as well as a morale boost to keep writing (affect). the 
unique style of distributed mentoring available in fanfiction
communities is one reason why young authors often choose 
to practice writing by creating fanfiction before attempting 
to write original fiction. authors mentioned that the feedback 
that they received from the fanfiction community was a key 
reason for their participation and that they viewed fanfiction
as an excellent training ground for aspiring writers who hope 
to produce original fiction one day. one published writer 
who had started out writing fanfiction commented in a blog 
post that she received more feedback in a week on her 
fanfiction than she had in several years on her original 
fiction. in the communities that we investigated, participants 
were very supportive of each other and eager to provide 
informal mentoring. the communities also provided a 
knowledge base and instant connection based on the fandom 
for anyone wishing to participate. the benefits derived from distributed mentoring are similar 
to the benefits associated with distributed cognition [30].
distributed mentoring provides artifacts that are embodied 
outside the author, such as forum responses, reviews, private 
messages, and author’s notes. these artifacts, as in 
distributed cognition, allow for the coordination and 
aggregation of mentoring efforts. as well, the distribution of 
access to information among these artifacts in the contexts 
we studied allowed for error checking in the form of 
agreement, 
disagreement, 
and 
discussion 
among 
respondents, just like in a cognitive system.
",,,,
5,,,"the term “mentoring” has been used in so many different 
ways and contexts that experiences referred to as mentoring 
may be quite distinct from each other. as a result, dawson
[18] argued for the specification of mentoring models and 
provided a common framework for researchers to use in 
crafting their definitions. mentoring is not limited to formal 
relationships between an older, more experienced mentor 
and a younger, less experienced mentee, which dawson 
refers to as “traditional,” but instead may take place between 
participants of all ages, with different levels of engagement 
and formality. based on a survey of mentoring literature and 
feedback 
from 
mentoring 
professionals, 
dawson’s
framework contains sixteen dimensions along which to 
classify 
mentoring 
relationships; 
objectives, 
roles, 
cardinality, tie strength, relative seniority, time, selection, 
matching, activities, resources and tools, role of technology, 
training, rewards, policy, monitoring, and termination.
drawing on dawson’s [18] mentoring framework, we classify 
fanfiction sites as informal, weakly tied, peer-based, many-to-
one or many-to-many, cmc-only [21] mentoring intended to 
improve certain skills—in the present analysis, writing skills. 
the mentoring is informal and weakly tied because the 
engagement between authors may be spontaneous and 
limited to a single incident, or it may build into a longer 
relationship if the authors are interested. the community 
participants taking part in this mentoring are all peers in the 
same affinity space in which there is no prescribed formal 
hierarchy. the large number of participants involved in the 
mentoring indicates a many-to-one or many-to-many 
experience that is distinct from simply having multiple 
mentors.
","interviews
we conducted in-depth interviews with 28 fanfiction authors 
via the private messaging systems on fanfiction.net and 
fimfiction.net. sixteen of the authors were members of 
fanfiction.net and 12 were members of fimfiction.net. 
twelve authors wrote my little pony fanfiction, nine authors 
wrote doctor who fiction, and seven authors wrote harry 
potter fiction. following previous research involving online communities
[17,45], we selected authors through a process of purposive
sampling, whereby members of the research team identified 
individuals who were active authors and reviewers in one of 
the chosen fandoms. we did this by looking at published 
stories on fanfiction.com and fimfiction.com with at least a 
small number of reviews and then viewing the author’s user 
profile to ascertain if they were currently active on the site, had 
regularly received reviews on their writing and were likely 
within the age and language demographic of the study.
","many authors experienced mentoring in fanfiction
communities as a reciprocal process. author 6 described how the mentoring she received early on inspired her to provide 
the same support in a one-on-one mentoring context for a 
new writer:i'll just add to the mentoring point - it's sort of come full 
cycle for me. when the girl pm'd [private messaged] me 
asking for advice, i did realise that i used to be her. back 
in the day i wrote so badly that people flaming and 
trolling me would've been perfectly viable. luckily i had 
people to push me up and advise me to turn me into the 
author i am today, so i found it really important to do 
exactly the same for her.
- author 6 (doctor who)
","the whole of the mentoring experience provided by 
distributed mentoring is greater than the sum of its parts. 
distributed mentoring creates richer mentoring experiences 
than individual mentors alone could provide, much like how 
distributed cognition allows cognitive systems to accomplish 
tasks that would be otherwise impossible for individuals to 
complete. a single mentor can provide only one perspective, 
and if a writer asks multiple mentors independently, it will 
be up to the author to decide which pieces of advice are 
sound. in fimfiction.net group discussions, authors can 
learn from the different pieces of advice individually and 
also learn from the discussion between the respondents. in 
these discussions, bad advice is corrected, good advice is 
validated, and more nuanced answers to questions form as a result of the respondents building off of each other
(aggregation, 
accretion, 
and 
acceleration). 
on 
fanfiction.net, authors are able to learn from reviews that 
focus on different aspects of the story and from reviewers 
who may be more critical or more positive. in addition, 
inflammatory reviews are moderated by reviewers’ 
responses, and responses to author’s notes provide targeted 
assistance for authors.
",,,,
6,,,"the advent of networked technologies has opened up new 
possibilities for learning and mentoring
that stretch 
dawson’s [18] framework and reveal its limitations. stahl, 
koschmann, and suthers [53] referred to “fundamentally 
social technologies” to describe technologies with specific 
affordances that support social interactions and group learning [53]. with respect to mentoring in particular, 
affordances 
such 
as 
asynchronous 
communication, 
anonymity, and persistent, searchable content introduce 
advantages 
of 
computer-mediated 
mentoring 
versus 
traditional mentoring, including a record of interactions, 
equalization of status, and reduced interaction costs [21]. 
communication within online fanfiction communities is by 
its very nature computer-mediated and, therefore, generates 
a persistent record of the interactions between authors and 
readers for both to learn from at their leisure. there is no 
overt distinction among authors on their profile pages; all 
authors may choose whether or not to include demographic 
information. in such a context, the age-based distinctions 
typical of offline settings are not as overt in online fanfiction
communities, providing teens and emerging adults with 
unique opportunities to assume mentoring roles [32]. in addition 
to the decreased cost of reader interactions mentioned earlier, 
these qualities distinguish the mentoring occurring in fanfiction
communities from more traditional, non-computer-mediated 
mentoring.
","we chose to target authors between the ages of 18-25 so that 
we might better identify individuals who had recently 
encountered—or were currently engaged in—a mentoring 
experience in their formative years; however, some authors 
did fall out of this range, with an average age of 22.8, the 
youngest 13 and the eldest 30. we also chose to interview authors who were native english speakers and who had been 
writing fanfiction for more than one year.
","the advice that author 6 received in lieu of inflammatory 
comments also illustrates the supportive nature of the 
fanfiction community, where groups of authors are willing to 
provide feedback in order to help new writers grow (the 
influence of affect is described below).
","as in other affinity spaces, participants in online fanfiction
communities can be any age, from any location, and of any 
experience level. there are no defined roles of “master” and 
“apprentice” in these communities because one author might 
possess deep knowledge on a certain topic, e.g. 
characterization, and yet be lacking in another aspect, e.g.
grammar. this diversity of expertise and the lack of defined 
roles in online fanfiction communities are of benefit in 
distributed 
mentoring 
situations 
because 
different 
participants can bring up different perspectives in their 
feedback. also, because distributed mentoring is peer-based, 
or horizontal, rather than hierarchical, an author who asks for 
assistance can turn around and provide feedback for another 
author on a different topic. the authors we interviewed 
revealed the important role that reciprocity played in the 
fanfiction community, indicating that the help they received 
inspired them to help others (acceleration).
",,,,
7,,,"distributed cognition and mentoring
hutchins’ [30] theory of distributed cognition is useful for 
understanding the dynamics involved in coordinated group 
processes, such as those that are found in affinity spaces like 
online fanfiction communities. instead of considering the 
individual mind as the unit of cognitive analysis, distributed 
cognition takes into account a system consisting of the 
individuals as well as their “information environment,” 
which includes the tools and artifacts used as part of 
cognition [31].
since hutchins’ initial exploration in offline environments, 
distributed cognition has been applied to computer-mediated 
interactions [15] and promoted as a theoretical foundation for 
human-computer interaction [28]. in addition, aragon and 
williams [4] drew upon distributed cognition in their study 
of distributed affect in collaborative creativity, expanding the 
focus of communication to include not only cognition but 
emotion.
","in order to protect the privacy of our subjects, and given the 
complex issue of gender binaries and fluidity—which is 
often the subject of fanfiction stories—we did not require 
them to identify their gender. we instead chose to seek a 
gender balance through the selection of our primary research 
sites: fanfiction.net and fimfiction.net. fanfiction.net has a 
primarily female audience [1] while fimfiction.net’s 
audience is predominantly male [2]. of those subjects who 
did openly offer a gender identity, 9 identified as female (all 
were from fanfiction.net) and 3 identified as male (with 2 
from fimfiction.net and one from fanfiction.net).
","author 19 (my little pony) went so far as to express that one 
of the key reasons for participating in fanfiction was the 
review structure, stating “i write fanfiction because you can 
get immediate feedback from an active fandom. i have to play 
my part as well, and give back to the community.”the importance of reviews
fanfiction reviews present a particularly fertile ground for 
mentoring, where authors can learn from the tens, hundreds, 
or even thousands of reviews left on their work. 
fanfiction.net’s user base is much larger and more diverse 
than fimfiction.net’s, which may explain why it lacks the 
user 
group 
activity 
and 
community 
feeling 
of 
fimfiction.net. however, stories posted on fanfiction.net 
tend to receive a large number of reader reviews; therefore, 
we investigated the mentoring present in these reviews as 
another space for a distributed form of mentoring.
","participation in affinity spaces and participatory cultures is 
predicated on participants’ intersubjective understanding of 
the context in which they are taking part, just like the ship 
navigators and pilots described by hutchins [30] and 
hutchins and klausen [31]. in our observations, the 
substantial number of reviews involving some form of 
fandom discussion provided evidence that authors and 
reviewers share a common base of language and knowledge. 
indeed, their shared knowledge goes beyond what is 
represented in the canonical literature to include fan canon 
notions of untold character backstories, favored relationship 
pairings, and popular plot conspiracies. our analysis 
suggests that the communitarian ethos present in the civil, 
reciprocal exchanges in online fanfiction communities is 
likely encouraged by the membership that authors feel as 
participants in the community.
",,,,
8,,,"the durable and distributed nature of online text-based 
communication allows for easy discussion, coordination, and 
error checking between participants dispersed across the 
globe [19,53]. distributed cognition aids the understanding 
of a specific type of interaction in fanfiction communities: 
mentoring among participants. a fanfiction author residing 
in a small town in the united states can receive reviews and 
advice from individuals in any location, at any time, and 
much like in a cognitive system, each individual in this 
mentoring system can build on the other participants’ 
insights. interactions among geographically dispersed 
participants are facilitated by their shared knowledge of and 
interest in a particular fandom, including its characters, plot 
points, and universe. although this mentoring system 
features key attributes of distributed cognition, such as the 
embodied representation of information in artifacts of the 
system (e.g. reviews) and the existence of a cognitive 
ecosystem, distributed mentoring also includes many additional features enabled by the affordances of networked 
publics, such as the ability to easily set up asynchronous 
communication, or the aggregation of pieces of information 
that ordinarily might be too small to provide meaningful 
mentoring, but that taken as a whole enable learning and skill 
development.
","the interviews included questions about community 
participation, mentoring, writing skills, and identity. 
adopting 
charmaz’s 
constructivist 
grounded 
theory 
approach that builds upon glaser, strauss, and corbin’s 
methods [13], and guided by our research questions [48,56],
members of our research team created a list of dominant 
themes that emerged directly from a close reading of the 
interview transcripts [56]. through weekly research team 
meetings in which we reviewed the transcripts, discussed 
relationships among the themes, and wrote memos reflecting 
upon our process and observations, we collectively distilled 
the themes into the following four categories: 1) learning from 
writing fanfiction; 2) fanfiction’s impact on life; 3) mentoring; 
and 4) the importance of fanfiction reviews. we used these 
themes to guide the focus of our participant observations.
","we observed that many reviewers provide thoughtful, 
detailed recommendations. these reviews let authors know 
specifically what they are doing well and what they need to 
work on. author 23 recalled his experience as a beginning 
author as motivation to provide feedback:
i usually search for beginning authors and leave tips 
on how to improve. such as better pacing, less telling, 
and most of all, trying to tone down a mary sue [self-
insertion] type character or red and black alicorn oc 
[original characters]. what prompts me to leave
feedback is that i used to be as inexperienced or 
beginning as a newbie on the site just like them not 
too long ago, so if i can help in any way, i'm going to 
try my hardest.
- author 23 (my little pony)often, authors of substantive reviews identified themselves 
as part of the larger fandom community by demonstrating 
deep knowledge of the canon or fanon material and by 
providing corrective feedback for authors who made 
mistakes with regard to the canon:okay, i have one slight issue. hermione doesn’t learn 
the patronus charm until her fifth year, so did being 
inside of harry’s head give her the ability to do it? if 
so, how would she know it was an otter if she wasn’t 
supposed to have learned it yet.  while these types of detailed reviews may be the most
relevant for helping writers improve their craft, the 
cumulative encouragement contained in a collection of many 
shallow positive reviews (e.g. “great story!”) must not be 
discounted. we learned from participant observation and 
interviews that reviews are a crucial source of motivation for 
authors, and receiving a large number of any type of 
encouraging reviews reportedly helps authors persevere in an 
activity that requires substantial effort but provides few 
rewards aside from personal satisfaction. the cumulative 
encouragement present in large numbers of reviews (what we 
term abundance, described in more detail below) may also 
help authors understand if they are on the right track in terms 
of story aspects like plot, pacing, and writing style. author 4 
indicated she has written hundreds of reviews because she 
knows how important they are: 
","implications
previous research investigating fanfiction has looked at how 
the mentoring that authors receive via interactions with other 
community members impacts their identity [6–8] and 
improves their writing ability [35]. however, there was a 
lack of research into the relationship between these 
individual-level effects and the group-level qualities of 
fanfiction communities, such as the massive scale of 
mentoring; its distributed nature across individuals, time, and 
platforms; and the distinct characteristics of author-mentor 
and mentor-mentor interactions. in particular, our work 
extends black’s research [6–8] by broadening the focus 
beyond a small number of fanfiction authors, a single 
fanfiction repository (fanfiction.net), and a single fanfictiongenre (anime). this broader view allowed us to detect 
common patterns of mentoring across different fanfiction
communities, indicating that distributed mentoring is not 
limited to one specific context or group of participants. in 
addition, by focusing on mentoring at the group- rather than 
the individual-level, we were able to document the patterns 
and effects of multiple sources of feedback in the aggregate. 
central to this analysis was an enumeration of the distinct 
affordances of networked technologies and how they 
distinguish distributed mentoring from traditional models of 
mentoring. by extending black’s research [6–8] in this way, our 
work provides new insight into leveraging the affordances of 
networked publics to support and promote collaborative 
learning.
",,,,
9,,,"the current study builds on previous work by investigating 
the distinct mentoring processes involved in online fanfiction
communities. we focused our research on three popular 
fandoms: harry potter, doctor who, and my little pony: 
friendship is magic. previous research related to these 
fandoms has focused on fan identities [39], gender and 
sexuality [26,58], civic engagement and fan activism
[27,37], copyright issues [14,51], and fan community 
engagement [60], rather than on mentoring processes related 
to fanfiction writing in these fandoms.
","participant observation
we used participant observations to explore in situ the themes 
that surfaced in the interviews and to further refine our theory. 
following boellstorff et al. [9], we were transparent about our 
position as researchers throughout the process.
","according to my general user stats page, i've 
submitted 796 reviews on ffn dot net. i usually leave 
reviews for stories i really enjoy, or for stories i find 
don't have many reviews. i make it an effort to review 
everything i read. i know how much reviews are 
appreciated on this site.
- author 4 (doctor who)overall, we found that reviewers were primarily providing 
supportive comments on the text rather than negative 
responses. our interviews and observations suggest that 
shared interest in the fandom generates a sense of kinship and 
contributes to the positive atmosphere of the community. in 
the relatively infrequent instances when negative comments 
were posted, we observed far more community members 
come to the defense of the author of the story being 
criticized. one controversial fanfiction story contained 
several flame reviews but even more reviews like this one 
defending the author:
just ignore the stupid tart-lover [reference to a doctor who 
character] who is leaving those horrid reviews. she can take 
all her stuffy little remarks and shove them where the light 
don’t shine. this is a fantastic story, i just had a shitty day 
and this story has really helped me smile.
this quote also illustrates the fact that many fanfiction
reviewers are engaged in dialogue with other reviewers and 
authors and are considering other feedback and notes as they 
construct their reviews. in other words, the mentoring 
activity is not focused exclusively on a single author, but 
demonstrates high levels of interaction among reviewers, 
what we term accretion and acceleration (described below). 
this emergent, complex structure within the mentoring 
activity is a key attribute of distributed mentoring.
","for instance, the insights from the present study suggest that 
distributed mentoring could be successfully applied to 
formal educational contexts as a useful peer mentoring 
mechanism, building on previous related work exploring the 
incorporation of fanfiction in classroom settings [43,49]. an 
internet-based peer review system joining a number of 
classrooms together would help facilitate distributed 
mentoring. students in one classroom could be tasked with 
contributing comments to the work of students in other 
classrooms. by interacting with students from another 
classroom, located in a different school or perhaps even a 
different city or country, the pseudonymous nature of 
distributed mentoring would be maintained. this geographic 
and emotional distance could help to prevent feelings of 
inhibition that students might feel if asked to give and receive 
feedback from the classmates they see and interact with on a 
daily basis. moreover, students would be able to benefit from 
encountering, considering, and responding to perspectives 
different from their own [29,52]. gee states that “[networked 
publics] are allowing people with no official credentials from 
formal institutions to become experts,” and this development 
of expertise can be encouraged in classroom settings [25].
our findings suggest that students should be encouraged to 
leave a small amount of feedback for each piece of writing 
they are to review, making sure to read and build upon 
previous comments. in this way, students could learn from 
the interactions of their reviewers in addition to the different 
perspectives presented in each review, which is what makes 
distributed mentoring such a rich learning experience. the 
attributes observed in spontaneous forms of distributed 
mentoring could be used to evaluate and refine these planned 
mentoring systems. black [8] saw adolescents motivated to 
participate in fanfiction spaces by the experience of 
procedural knowledge (as contrasted to propositional 
knowledge) and opportunities to contribute to the function of 
the space. therefore, a distributing mentoring model in the 
classroom would need to maintain such features to sustain 
student engagement.

10,,,,"to start our participant observation and help integrate 
ourselves into the community [6,9], each team member wrote 
a short fanfiction on a fandom of his or her choice and 
published it on a relevant fanfiction repository. this exercise 
provided us with an understanding of the author’s 
perspective and lent us credibility as fans when contacting 
other authors.
","the seven attributes of distributed mentoring
the themes emerging from the author interviews guided our 
participant observations and led us to identify seven 
attributes that describe the mentoring processes we observed. 
these attributes are: aggregation, accretion, acceleration, 
abundance, availability, asynchronicity, and affect. despite 
some differences in mentoring style across platforms (e.g. 
user groups on fimfiction.net), we found evidence of all 
seven attributes across the fandoms and platforms we 
studied.
aggregation: authors experienced mentoring from a number 
of different sources. powered by the openly networked 
nature of computer-mediated communication, the authors in 
our study received numerous small pieces of advice in the 
form of story reviews or discussion forum responses that, as 
in distributed cognition [30], created a whole far greater than 
the sum of its parts. the feedback provided independently by 
each participant may not be sufficient in either depth or 
longevity to be considered mentoring on its own. instead, 
authors are being mentored in the aggregate by the fanfiction
community at large.
","in addition, distributed mentoring holds implications for the 
design of online affinity spaces. as the differences between
fanfiction.net and fimfiction.net illustrate, website design 
facilitates or discourages different types of interactions. the common features across these sites, such as comment threads 
and discussion groups, suggest that these interest-driven 
communities already afford rich distributed mentoring. the 
power of distributed mentoring comes in part from the 
numerous responses or reviews that authors receive. as an 
author receives more replies, the mentoring experience 
becomes richer. more could be done, however, to help 
authors who are not receiving a lot of feedback to benefit 
from distributed mentoring. although it is currently possible 
to browse fanfiction sites by number of reviews, readers have 
to intentionally seek out stories with few reviews. a simple 
recommender that directs community members who have 
just left a review to similar stories that have few or no 
reviews may help to channel feedback to stories that need it 
most. such a system could also steer readers and writers to 
similar stories, thus affording more community formation 
and participation. affective features such as easy ways to 
“like” or categorize stories could enhance positive 
experiences. developers could also enhance the mentoring 
experience for contributors who receive large numbers of 
reviews by adding tools that use text mining techniques to 
automatically synthesize common themes or contrasting 
viewpoints.
",,,,
11,,,,"the member-created groups on fimfiction.net served as a 
primary site for our participant observations. the five 
fimfiction.net groups observed each had between 1,000 and 
5,000 members and focused on writing help and discussion. 
three groups were spaces for struggling authors to ask 
questions, one group was a “school” to help writers learn 
their craft, and the largest, most active group was a general 
writing community that allowed questions and discussion. we observed these groups over a period of nine months, taking 
notes and screen captures of what we saw. each team member 
spent 5-10 hours per week observing the communities. this 
time was spent reading stories and reviews of recently published 
works and older stories, viewing reddit and community posts, 
and participating in writing events within the communities such as national novel writing month (nanowrimo). additionally, 
we communicated informally via private message with 
members of the fimfiction.net groups to ask them questions 
about their participation; these members were chosen when 
interesting behavior or topics were observed. none of the
individuals
contacted 
informally 
through
participant 
observation were also part of the interview phase of the study. our
observations also included
author and reviewer 
communications on fanfiction.net. because fanfiction.net 
lacks the group activity of fimfiction.net, reader reviews 
and author’s notes are potentially the richest source of 
publicly viewable mentoring data on the site. any reader can 
leave a review of a fanfiction on fanfiction.net, either 
anonymously without creating an account or through a 
registered account. it is common practice for authors to leave 
notes either at the beginning or end of their work, and these 
notes will sometimes reference comments they have received 
in previous reviews or ask for reviewers’ input on specific 
aspects of the work. we spent 10-20 collective hours each 
week reading stories, reviews, profiles, and author’s notes on 
fanfiction.net.
","i can't think of any one person [in particular who has 
influenced me], i take inspiration from a number of 
people. 
- (author 19, my little pony)based on our observation of reviews, an author who receives 
even ten reviews on his or her work is likely to receive five 
targeted pieces of feedback in addition to several other 
encouraging remarks. together, this aggregated feedback 
may let authors know what they have done well and what is 
lacking in their fanfiction stories. even numerous shallow 
positive reviews can show authors collectively that they are 
on the right track.
",,,,,
12,,,,"our analyses of the participant observations served two 
primary purposes: 1) to corroborate themes surfaced in the 
interviews and 2) to examine processes of interpersonal 
communication among members of the fan communities. 
during the nine-month period of data collection, our team 
conducted a cumulative total of over a thousand hours of 
participant observation, generating several hundred pages of 
field notes, memos, and digests. this documentation was
shared amongst the team and discussed in weekly team 
meetings.
","accretion: reviewers themselves interacted with each other 
in a persistent, cumulative fashion, enabling an accretion of 
knowledge to facilitate the author’s learning process. the 
mentoring activity pertaining to the creation of an antagonist 
is an example of this (described on p. 6), where the process 
of developing a compelling antagonist in one’s story was 
carefully deconstructed by a group whose members built 
upon and extended previously posted commentary. through 
these distributed postings and exchanges, the information 
accreted over time, enabled by the persistent nature of the 
forum. the advice that authors received from this mentoring 
experience included targeted, cumulatively sophisticated and 
detailed feedback on their fanfiction stories and thorough 
answers to their questions posted on forums or in authors’ 
notes. acceleration: it is sometimes the case that authors receive 
conflicting feedback in the variety of reviews of their work. 
while this may at first seem confusing, we found that 
discussions and conflicts between reviewers typically yield a 
more complex and nuanced body of feedback as reviewers 
point out holes in each other's arguments or reinforce each 
other’s statements through agreement, cite deep fandom knowledge, and accelerate the process of learning through 
active discussion. we observed an interwoven network of 
reviewer responses delving into highly specialized knowledge 
and buttressing subtle points of argument.
",,,,,
13,,,,"during these discussions, we identified and highlighted 
evidence related to the dominant themes surfaced in the 
interviews. we paid particular attention to processes of 
mentoring among community participants. during the course 
of these weekly discussions and follow up analytic memos, 
we noted that mentoring appeared to be “distributed” across 
participants. authors received guidance from multiple 
reviewers, and these reviewers sometimes referenced and 
built on comments left by earlier reviewers. through this 
analytic process [13,48], we distilled seven attributes that 
together account for the full range of mentoring processes 
that we observed.
","abundance: the sheer volume of review responses 
contributes to the nature of distributed mentoring. by itself, 
a shallow positive comment is relatively meaningless. but if 
an author receives dozens or hundreds of such comments, the 
mere presence of positive feedback in such quantities 
provides important guidance to the writer. additionally, the 
existence of multiple channels of feedback and mentoring, 
such as private messaging, author’s notes, reviews, skype 
chats, etc. contribute to the multiplicity and abundance of 
distributed mentoring.
",,,,,
14,,,,"in the following sections, we report the dominant themes that 
emerged from our analysis of the author interviews, followed

i’ll just pop into one of my 30+ member skype chats 
and toss it out there. i can always expect good 
feedback there.
- (author 22, my little pony)availability: on fanfiction.net and fimfiction.net, the 
interactions of individual participants are visible to the larger 
community. the persistent and public nature of online text-
based communication ensures that reviews are available not 
just immediately after a story is written, but indefinitely, 
months or years into the future. this availability in turn 
facilitates long-term exchanges and relationships between 
reviewers and authors, as authors can post their stories and 
learn from their reviewers (and reviewers can learn from 
each other) years into the future, thus further broadening the 
effect of distributed mentoring.
",,,,,
15,,,,,"asynchronicity: the public, durable text interactions allow 
for asynchronous contributions by any person, at any time, 
no matter the location, enabling reviewers from multiple 
time zones around the globe to easily and continuously view 
and reply to other reviews. authors might post a story, go to 
sleep, and in the morning wake up to multiple thoughtful and 
lengthy critiques of their work, which they or other reviewers 
can then respond to as they wake up in their own time zones. 
this asynchronicity adds depth, immediacy, and continuity 
to a mentoring conversation. the power of asynchronous 
communication, especially in international communities 
operating in different time zones and outside work or school 
hours, has been noted in previous research on online 
community [5]. it is a crucial enabling factor for distributed 
mentoring.
",,,,,
16,,,,,"affect: in interviews, on forums, and in their author’s notes, 
fanfiction writers repeatedly mentioned positive affect or 
emotion generated by the encouragement and inspiration 
they received from reviews and feedback (see “the 
importance of reviews” above). negative reviews or flames 
were moderated by other reviewers creating a supportive 
community response. it is important not to ignore the 
emotional and supportive aspects of mentoring, especially 
with respect to adolescents who are forming their identities and building self-efficacy. the act of writing, even nonfiction 
writing, can be an emotionally charged event where otherwise 
highly skilled individuals find themselves unable to produce the 
written communication that is crucial for success in almost
every field of endeavor. authors in these communities cited the
emotional support they received as key to their growth as 
writers.
",,,,,
17,,,,,"these attributes and tendencies themselves are interwoven, 
as each contributes to and facilitates other attributes, further 
contributing to the interdependent and complex nature of 
distributed mentoring. for example, participants must be 
able to view the responses of others (availability) so they can 
take these diverse perspectives into consideration when 
creating their own responses or reviews (accretion), and 
respondents can directly contradict or support other 
respondents (acceleration). as the fanfiction stories we 
sampled increased in their number of reviews (aggregation),
we saw an increase in the amount of discussion present in these 
reviews, indicating that interactions in distributed mentoring 
become more complex and richer with increasing numbers of 
participants and responses.
",,,,,
18,,,,,"any phenomenon that draws millions of young people to 
participate and generate literary content, especially in a 
generation criticized for their inability to write coherently 
[11,23,59,62], is deserving of closer attention. in particular, 
understanding in more depth how networked publics facilitate 
this new type of learning and mentoring is vital for the future 
of formal and informal education as more and more young 
people spend a significant fraction of their waking hours 
online [23]. the seven attributes we identified form the 
beginning of an understanding of the underlying structure of 
this new kind of mentoring.",,,,,
